## Abstract
C4 and Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) have been considered as largely independent photosynthetic adaptations in spite of sharing key biochemical modules. _Portulaca_ is a geographically widespread clade of over 100 annual and perennial flowering plant species that primarily use C4 photosynthesis, but facultatively exhibit CAM when drought stressedâ€”a photosynthetic system known as C4+CAM. It has been hypothesized that the rarity of C4+CAM physiology is due to pleiotropic constraints, but these have not been deeply explored. We [sequenced the genome of _P. amilis_](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov) and sampled [mRNA from _P. amilis_ and _P. oleracea_ over the course of a CAM-induction experiment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Gene co-expression network analyses identified sets of genes involved in C4 and CAM shared and unique to both Portulaca species, as well as putative transcription factors and associated _cis_-regulatory motifs in _P. amilis_. A conserved set of co-expressed genes indicated that CAM evolved by linking phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC) to starch turnover during the day-night transition. Preservation of this co-expression module regardless of water status suggests that _Portulaca_ species constitutively operate a weak CAM cycle that is upregulated during drought. C4 and CAM mostly used mutually exclusive paralogs for primary carbon fixation, however it is likely that nocturnal CAM malate stores are shuttled into diurnal C4 decarboxylation pathways. C4 likely evolved in Portulaca through co-option of redundant paralogs and integration of the diurnal portion of CAM. Thus, the ancestral CAM system did not strongly constrain C4 gene expression evolution because photosynthetic gene networks are not co-regulated for both daytime and nighttime functions.
