This directory contains scans of the original measurements and sample identifiers as `.pdf`s and translations of those into `.csv`s. The four types of data collected are

1. Leaf tissue for _in situ_ hybridization of CAM and C4 specific mRNA.

  * `In_situ_samples.csv`
2. Measurements of stomatal conductance with a porometer. Note that these measurements stop after the final round of sampling _P. amilis_ and before the final round of sampling for _P. oleracea_. We found that the small, succulent leaves were not being accurately recorded by the porometer and discontinued these measurements.

3. Leaf tissue for mRNA sequencing for differential expression analyses.

  * `RNA_samples.csv`
4. Titratable acidity measurements for indicator (test) specimens and experimental specimens. One plant of each genotype was grown in the growth chamber alongside the experimental plants and leaves were sampled occasionally for titratable acidity as an indicator of CAM activity. There was no dedicated sampling sheet for these test specimens.
